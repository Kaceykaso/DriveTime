DriveTime
=========

Web app that utilizes the Google Maps API to give drive time estimates for a given set of locations.


<b>Problem</b>
......
I drive. A lot. And usually long distances, in peak traffic times.<br>
Often, I will sit in heavy traffic for an extra hour, as traffic is dying down, and get to my desitination in the same amount of time it would have taken had I just waited and left later; saving myself the mind-numbing pain that is the 405.<br>
I want to be able to easily monitor the estimated travel time for a given set of directions, and only leave after traffic has died down.



<b>Solution</b>
......
Build a tool that takes an input of two destinations from the user, and instead of simply returning the estimated drive time at that moment, continually refresh and recheck the estimated drivetime.<br>
Only when the current estimated drive time is under a given time (also from the user), is the user notified that their drivetime has been reached.


Note: This is a work in progress.
